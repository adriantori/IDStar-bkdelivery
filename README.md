# Burger King Delivery Clone Website

 This project is for IDStar's Front-End job requirement.

 Made using HTML, CSS, and JQuery.

 Deployment link : https://idstar-bk-adriantori.netlify.app

## Notes:

1.  This site is tested and responsive on 1440px, 1024px, 768px, 425px, and 375px.

2. Edge cases arent tested (i.e whether it breaks on 1234px).

3. This project implies to only work on the homepage, whether other pages need to be implemented, it will need confirmation from the Assignment Contact Person.

## What I implement

1. Desktop and Mobile navbar.

2. Links to the actual bkdelivery.com site.

3. Carousel using OwlCarousel2, just like the site did.

4. Adding dots under it and arrow with transparency on both side of it.

5. Swipe functionality on Carousel.

6. Show "Order Now" div thingy when Cart logo is hovered.

7. Hides Youtube icon on desktop and show it in mobile (not sure why BK do this).

## What I did differently

1. I increased some of the fonts, mainly because I have bad eyesight and slightly larger font is easier to read.

2. I used pure css and FontAwesome icon for Carousel arrow instead of static image.

3. I only put 6 items on the Menus section and 5 Carousel items because it should already show how the site works without unnecessary code on my side.

## What I cant do

1. Makes scrollbar transparent

2. Implement "Loading Gif" on the "Order Now" div thingy while it loads.

3. Straighten footer text with the items in Menus.

4. Enlarge fonts on smaller device (425px or lower) without breaking the text.
